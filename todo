Soon:
[ ] Caching and serving things from disk
[ ] Non-hardcoded favicon(s)

Later:
[ ] Updating things on disk from [some] S3 [compatible service]
[ ] Dymanically decide what should be in cache
[ ] Generating multiple sizes of images on demand
[ ] Minimizing content on demand
	[ ] HTML/template
	[ ] JavaScript
	[ ] CSS
[ ] Login/authentication
[ ] Contact email hidden behind signin
[ ] Comment system
	Need to have:
	[ ] (probably) More advanced caching
	[ ] Moderation utilities
	Nice to have:
	[ ] Report option
	[ ] Comment voting

To Decide:
[ ] Is index.html special? (baked into the binary?)

Done:
[x] Simple standard favicon (at path favicon.ico)
